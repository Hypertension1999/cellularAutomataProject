**How to install Cellular Automata (Windows)**
You may always find our latest executables at https://github.com/cptwalmart/cellularAutomataProject/releases
There are two types of installers, CellularAutomataInstaller and CellularAutomataInstaller(Windowless). The only difference between these two is if you want to see the command line window while your working with the program, which can be beneficial for debugging.

Simply download whichever version you'd prefer, and the windows installer will walk you through the rest of the process.

By default the application will install to C:\Program Files (x86)\Cellular Automata.

**How to use the code (Mac/Linux)**
If you would rather run our code directly instead of using an installer, either clone the repository on git or download the master zip. To ensure you have the correct dependencies run 'python -m pip install -r requirements.txt' in the terminal window. This will check to ensure you have all the required libraries for use with the program. After that simply run main.py with python.

**How to uninstall Cellular Automata**
Simply run the installer again to uninstall.
