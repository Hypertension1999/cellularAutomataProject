**Basics**
To create a cellular automaton, fill the data you would like to use into Default Input.

**Number of cells**: How large you would like your automaton to be
**Alphabet Size**: How many unique elements are in your automaton (ex Alphabet Size: 2 would be 0 1)
**Initial State**: What you would like the initial state of the automaton to be. You may choose 'random' for a random starting state
**Update Rule**: What cells you would like to compare to. Negative values goes that many cells to the left, zero compares to itself, and a positive value goes that many cells to the right. Program is written under the assumption that it will wrap around to the other end if it hits an edge. (ex -2 0 1 would be a valid update rule)
**Number of Steps**: How many 'steps' you would like the program to run for
