**Full Example**
In this example we are going to walk through the creation of an automaton. Our automaton will be of size 9, mod 2, with a random initial state, update rule 1 2 3, over 45 steps.

After inputting our data, this is what our Automaton looks like. We'd like to see some more detailed statistics of it, so we are going to run the complex cycle statistics on it.
After going to the **File->Save-Complex Statistics**, we choose what to save our example as.![enter image description here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/789179423051218955/789183057172234250/unknown.png)
After opening the new text file, we get something that looks like

So, now we have some more detailed information about our automaton.
